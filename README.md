# Clothing Retrieval System

This is a cloth retrieval system that suggests similar clothing items based on user-uploaded images. The system uses image features extracted using a pre-trained ResNet50 model to calculate similarity and provide recommendations.

## Overview

The Clothing Recommender System is designed to help users discover similar clothing items based on their preferences. Users can upload an image of a clothing item, and the system will identify and display the most visually similar items from the available inventory.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for image upload and recommendation display.
- Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction.
- Implements Nearest Neighbors algorithm for similarity calculation.
- Displays the top-N most similar clothing items as recommendations.
- Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG).
